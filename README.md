# # Alkimii Test

This is a simple example on implementing some functionalities in my Rails application. I will be using one of the latests versions (ruby 2.6.5p114) of Ruby on Rails.

Unzip the .zip file and run the server with the "rails server" command. It is accessed through the URL "http: // localhost: 3000 /"
